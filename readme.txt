Send blog posts as email newsletters to your subscribers from WordPress. Connect to Mailchimp, MailerLiteâ€¦

== Description ==
**Send blog posts as email newsletters to your subscribers from WordPress. Connect to Mailchimp, MailerLite (more soon...).**

## When it's time to share your latest post, do you:
**Look longingly at Substack**, wishing you could auto-publish to your site and subscribers too?

**Head grudgingly to Mailchimp** and painstakingly re-create your WordPress post as a newsletter?

**Hope to set up an RSS campaign...** One of these days?

**Rely uneasily on RSS**, because there's no way to confirm which version got sent, until it's in your inbox?

**Procrastinate?**

## What if you could just:
#### Check a box, and hit publish?

## When sharing past issues...
#### Do you share this?

> **Wait. How is this possible?**

> Simple - When your newsletter is a blog post, your newsletter archives are your blog archives.

## Here's how it works

**0:44 Onboarding starts:** I'll go from setting up Newsletter Glue from the first time to sending the first post to subscribers in 2 min 30 secs.

**4:07 "Send as newsletter" features inside the WordPress editor:** This is what you see for every post you send. We pre-load defaults for you so you don't have to fill everything out from scratch for every post you send. You can change the defaults in Settings.

**8:18 Status log:** See the sent/not sent status for every newsletter you send. Even when you send multiple newsletters from one post.

**9:05 Connect:** This is where you add new integrations to your email service providers (ESPs). Right now, we've only got Mailchimp (update: now we have MailerLite), but we plan on connecting lots more ESPs and other apps in the future!

**9:51 Settings:** Here's where you can change your email defaults (the pre-filled stuff in the WordPress editor).

There's also a Custom CSS section which you can use to add CSS to your newsletter which won't show up in your post.

 == Frequently Asked Questions == 
## FAQ
= What if I don't use Mailchimp or MailerLite? =

We're in the process of integrating other email service providers (ESP).

We'll have a feature requests page soon where you can go to vote for your ESP.

= How will my post look as an email? =

Your post will be sent as a simple and clean email. To see it, you can send a test email from inside the WordPress editor before publishing your post. This will let you check your post before sending it to all your subscribers.

= Does this just send plain text? What if I want a custom design? =

You can customise your newsletter design by adding custom CSS in the Settings. Go to Newsletter Glue > Settings > Custom CSS.

The CSS you add here will show up in the emails you send, but not in your blog posts.

= What if I don't want to publish my full post as a newsletter? =

You're not alone. Others use Newsletter Glue as it lets them use the WP editor to write their newsletter.

Simply add a new post, and create your newsletter. Don't forget to put it in a different category, so that your newsletter will have its own archive.

= Why not directly send from WordPress using SendGrid or Amazon SES, instead of connecting to an external email service provider? =

There's a lot more to email service providers (ESPs) than sending emails.

There's subscriber maintenance, tagging, scheduling, automation, sequences and more. Building an entire ESP inside WordPress isn't our focus right now.

If that's what you're looking for, MailPoet is an amazing option.

= Do you have a sign-up form I can add to my blog? =

We don't have a sign-up form right now. But we're thinking about building one...

For now, you can use a separate form plugin for this purpose. Mailchimp and MailerLite also has basic sign up forms to get you up and running quickly.

= I'm planning to set up a members-only newsletter with restricted content. Will your plugin do that? =


Glad you asked! We're launching these features at the end of the year. 

But in the mean time, you can use Paid Member Subscriptions or Paid Memberships Pro to set up your memberships.

You'll also need to set up a corresponding tag inside Mailchimp for your paid members. 

And when it comes time to publish, all you need to do is select the right subscriber tag to ensure you're only sending your email to paid members.

= Will you have a premium upgrade? =

We're working on it! Stay tuned!
