 == Frequently Asked Questions == 
## FAQ
= What if I don't use Mailchimp, MailerLite, Sendinblue or Campaign Monitor, ActiveCampaign or GetResponse? =

We're in the process of integrating other email service providers (ESP). Check back for more updates soon!

= Does this work with Gutenberg blocks or classic editor?

Newsletter Glue works best with Gutenberg. But you will also be able to use it easily with the classic editor.

= Does this work with page builders?

Newsletter Glue currently does not work with any page builders. But we plan to do so in the near future. Check back soon!

= How will my post look as an email? =

Your post will be sent as a simple and clean email. To see it, you can send a test email from inside the WordPress editor before publishing your post. This will let you check your post before sending it to all your subscribers.

= Does this just send plain text? What if I want a custom design? =

You can customise your newsletter design with the Newsletter Theme Designer. Go to Newsletter Glue > Settings > Newsletter Theme Designer. You can also add custom CSS in the Settings.

The CSS you add here will show up in the emails you send, but not in your blog posts.

To learn more about adding custom CSS to your email newsletter, [head here](https://docs.newsletterglue.com/article/17-newsletter-theme-designer).

= What if I don't want to publish my full post as a newsletter? =

You're not alone. Others use Newsletter Glue as it lets them use the WP editor to write their newsletter.

Simply add a new post, and create your newsletter. Don't forget to put it in a different category, so that your newsletter will have its own archive.

= Why connect to an email service provider (instead of building on inside WordPress? =

No need to migrate anything. Don't touch your existing setup.

* Email lists, segments, tags
* Automated email sequences
* DKIM, SPF records
* Campaign data

= Do you have a subscriber form I can add to my blog? =

We have a subscriber form in our [pro plugin](https://newsletterglue.com).

= I'm planning to set up a members-only newsletter with restricted content. Will your plugin do that? =

Glad you asked! Check out this [mega guide](https://newsletterglue.com/blog/build-newsletter/paid-newsletter-setup/) we wrote that takes you step-by-step on how you can do that.

== Changelog ==

= 1.2.0, February 9, 2021 =

* **New improvement:** We've made huge improvements to our publishing workflow. Our new "Send as newsletter" interface is cleaner and dramatically reduces the chances of you accidentally sending emails when publishing or updating your post.

= 1.1.13, January 31, 2021 =

* **New integration:** GetResponse is now integrated!
* **Improvement:** List styling now follows paragraph styling.
* **Bug fix for Sendinblue users:** Fixed bug causing unverified emails to be wrongly marked as verified. This was preventing emails from getting sent.

= 1.1.12, January 26, 2021 =

* **New integration:** ActiveCampaign is now integrated!
* Added ability to explore pro blocks and upgrade to PRO from **Newsletter Block Manager**

= 1.1.11, January 8, 2021 =

* **Bug fix for Mailchimp:** Preview text was not displaying for newsletters sent via Mailchimp. This is now fixed.

= 1.1.10, January 6, 2021 =

* **Bug fix for Campaign Monitor:** Fixed a bug that caused newsletter to be sent to only one list when selecting multiple lists.
* **Bug fix for Sendinblue:** Fixed a bug that caused sending newsletter to fail, because of an encoding issue.

= 1.1.9, December 21, 2020 =

* **Bug fix for MailerLite:** Fixed a bug that was causing MailerLite newsletters to save inside MailerLite, instead of being sent out. It's an encoding bug with emogrifier.

= 1.1.8, December 16, 2020 =

**New features**

* **Strip Newsletter Glue's default CSS:** This is a feature for advanced users who want to completely remove all our CSS from their emails and replace it with their own.

**Improvements**

* **In-line CSS:** We've rebuilt our plugin so that all CSS is inserted inline. There are many advantages, including: we use less code (loads faster, cleaner, less chance of clipping) and forwarded emails retain their styling.
* **Preview email in new tab:** Next to "Send test email" you'll now find a "Preview email" button. This lets you quickly preview emails in your browser, instead of sending a test email every time.
* **Image captions** now align bottom center for each image.
* **Campaign Monitor users must select a list ID before sending an email:** Blank ID lists now cause an error message and sending is disabled. Previously, we allowed users to send emails without selecting a list. Emails would then get stuck on the backend as Campaign Monitor requires a list in order to send.

**Bug fixes**

* **Bug fix for Mailchimp audiences:** Previously only showed up to 10 audiences. We now show the maximum 1000 audiences.

= 1.1.7, December 3, 2020 =

* **New feature:** We've added a double confirmation when sending *updated* newsletters. Next to **Your email is ready to publish** notification, you'll now see an additional checkbox.

Your workflow when **publishing** a new newsletter will remain the same. This new checkbox is automatically checked for you, but you can uncheck it.

However, your **updating** workflow is now improved. This new checkbox is **un-checked** for posts that are being updated. This solves the problem of saving an updated post and accidentally sending out a newsletter. Only check this box once you're ready.

* **Bug fix:** If a post was previously published then duplicated using the Yoast Duplicate Post plugin, its published status will also show up in the duplicated post. This is now fixed.
* **Bug fix:** Link colour chosen in newsletter theme designer not showing up in emails for Mailchimp.
* **Improvement:** Remove CPTs that are obviously not for posting content. Like oEmbeds, menus, custom CSS, custom fields, blocks, forms etc...

= 1.1.6, November 12, 2020 =

* **New feature:** Add preview text to each newsletter. Preview text shows up next to your Subject line in inboxes. It's a great way to give subscribers a sneak peek of your email and convince them to open it. Find it next to the **Subject** field in the **Send as newsletter** section.
* **New feature:** You can now choose if you want to add the blog post's title to the top of each newsletter. Previously, every newsletter automatically added the blog post title. This gives you more flexibility and control over your newsletter's layout. Find this feature at the bottom of the Newsletter Theme Designer (Newsletter Glue > Settings > Newsletter Theme Designer).
* **New feature:** Alignment options (left, center, right) for headers and paragraph text can now be found in the Newsletter Theme Designer. Note this will only show up in your newsletter. It will not affect or appear in your published blog post or in your block editor.

= 1.1.5, October 29, 2020 =

* **Improvement:** You can now choose to **disable** Newsletter Glue on selected custom post types. Go to **Newsletter Glue > Settings > Additional** tab to do this.
* Minor UI and copy improvements.

= 1.1.4, October 13, 2020 =

* **Bug fix:** Fixed bug causing our **show/hide content** blocks to "break" some CSS.

= 1.1.3, October 7, 2020 =

* You can now add your logo to your newsletter in the **newsletter theme designer**.

**New integration:**

* We now connect with **Campaign Monitor**!

**Improvements:**

* Added **"Send as newsletter" checkbox** on the top toolbar in the **post editor**. This lets you quickly confirm you'll be sending a newsletter when you hit the **Publish/Update button**, and makes it easy to turn off the option.
* "Add header image" is now changed to "Add featured image" to make it clearly different from the new logo feature. This can now be found in the **newsletter theme designer**.
